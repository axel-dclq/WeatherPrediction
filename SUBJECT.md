# Building a Bayesian Network-Based Weather Forecasting Application

**Objective:** Develop a Python-based weather forecasting application that utilizes Bayesian networks to predict weather conditions based on historical data and user inputs.

**Requirements:**
1. Proficiency in Python programming.
2. Understanding of Bayesian networks and probability theory.
3. Access to historical weather data (can be obtained from online datasets or APIs).
4. Familiarity with libraries such as NumPy and pandas.

**Task Details:**

**1. Data Collection:**
   - Obtain historical weather data for a specific geographic area or city. Consider using sources like OpenWeatherMap, historical weather databases, or government weather data repositories.
   - Organize and store the data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel) for analysis.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleanse and preprocess the collected data to address issues such as missing values, outliers, and irrelevant information.
   - Select relevant features from the dataset, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and cloud cover.

**3. Bayesian Network Structure:**
   - Design the structure of the Bayesian network by specifying nodes and edges.
   - Define the relationships among nodes, such as how humidity, temperature, and cloud cover influence the likelihood of rain.

**4. Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs):**
   - Assign conditional probability tables (CPTs) to each node in the Bayesian network based on historical data.
   - For example, the CPT for rain might depend on humidity, temperature, and cloud cover.

**5. User Interface:**
   - Create an intuitive user interface for users to input location, date, and time for the weather forecast.
   - Allow users to select specific weather parameters they are interested in (e.g., temperature, precipitation).

**6. Inference Engine:**
   - Implement algorithms for Bayesian network inference. You can choose between exact inference methods (e.g., variable elimination) or approximate methods like Monte Carlo methods.
   - Calculate the probability distribution of the selected weather parameters based on user input and the Bayesian network.

**7. Weather Forecast Presentation:**
   - Display the weather forecast to the user, including probabilities of different weather conditions (e.g., 70% chance of rain, 30% chance of sunshine).
   - Use visualizations such as graphs or charts to represent the forecasted data effectively.

**8. Testing and Validation:**
   - Thoroughly test the application using various historical data inputs to ensure accurate weather forecasts.
   - Validate the predictions against real-world weather data to assess the application's performance.

**9. Documentation:**
   - Create comprehensive documentation in GitHub Readme file that explains how to use the application.
   - Include details about the Bayesian network structure, assumptions made, and the reasoning behind parameter choices.


**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Accuracy of weather forecasts.
- User-friendliness and aesthetics of the interface.
- Efficiency of Bayesian network implementation.
- Quality and clarity of documentation.
